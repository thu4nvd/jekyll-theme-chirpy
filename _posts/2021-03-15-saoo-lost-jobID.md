## Solution

After managed node make it known OS from unknown OS itâ€™s working fine and job not got failed and job id got created.

Check OS type on SA CLient GUI, or even run bs_software command from SA Agent of both servers ( to compare).

bs_software and bs_hardware are two script files installed by the agent installer in the following location:

~~~
%ProgramFiles%\Opsware\agent\pylibs\cog #Windows
/opt/opsware/agent/pylibs/cog #Unix
~~~
